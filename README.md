# Local AI-assisted Development
Local AI-assisted Development (or LAID for short) is a series of experiments to use Local Large Language Models (L-LLMs) to do AI assisted software development. I plan on using the following workflow:

1. **LM Studio**: LM Studio will host the model and provide OpenAI like endpoints to access the model
2. **LAID Script/Extension**: This will write the prompts, provide LLM the context and allow it to read, edit, and delete files.
3. **Visual Studio Code**: I will use this to monitor what my code looks like, make any modifications if I need to.
5. **Git**: This will save changes and help to diff.
