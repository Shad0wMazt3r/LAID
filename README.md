## LAID — Local AI-Assisted Development

**LAID** (Local AI-Assisted Development) is an experimental toolset for leveraging local large language models (L-LLMs) to enhance your software development workflow.

### Project Overview

This project integrates the following components into a seamless local AI-assisted development pipeline:

1. **LM Studio** — Runs your local L-LLM and exposes it via API endpoints mimicking those of OpenAI.
2. **LAID** — Interfaces with the L-LLM to:

   * Manage prompts
   * Maintain contextual continuity
   * Manage file operations (reading, writing, modifying, deleting)
   * Allow Tool Calling
3. **Visual Studio Code (optional)** — Allows you to review, edit, and collaborate on code generated by the LAID script.
4. **Git** — Tracks your changes and lets you review diffs across iterations.

### Getting Started

1. Install LM Studio and download your favorite model(s).
2. Start server in the developer panel of LM Studio.
3. Clone and run LAID

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shad0wMazt3r/LAID
    cd LAID
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

### Repository Structure

* `laid.json` — Configuration settings
* `main.py` — Primary application logic
* `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
* Folders:

  * `config/`
  * `core/`
  * `models/`
  * `tools/`
  * `ui/`

### Key Features

* **Local LLM Integration** via LM Studio
* **File Manipulation** — Create, edit, and delete code files through L-LLM instructions
* **Command Execution** for fine-grained development control
* **CVE Vulnerability Search** to enhance security checks
* **Agent Operation Modes** — Supports planning, acting, and verbose logging flows
* **Interruptible Workflow** — Pause/resume execution using Ctrl+C
